            I am a magician who has stolen the power of computers and utilized it to bring my creative ideas to life and satisfy my diverse curiosity. For example, I have worked on ship route planning problems, written corresponding papers, and integrated planning algorithms into unmanned surface vehicles (USVs)/ships under different constraints. I have also used various methods, such as deep learning, machine learning, and embedded systems, to replace manual flame picking and ink smoke monitoring during Huizhou Ink production, contributing my share to the protection of intangible cultural heritage. Most importantly, motivated by a genuine passion for robotics, I founded my university’s first robotics lab and have dedicated myself to robotics research over the years. Now I am pursuing my dream of flying by designing and completing a set of autonomous high-speed flying vehicles with obstacle avoidance capabilities.

            Since 2018, robotics learning and competitions have occupied most of my spare time. I come from a remote pastoral region—an underdeveloped nomadic area where, from a very young age, I lived amidst frequent sandstorms, unreliable transportation, and a harsh natural environment. In my hometown, people made their living through herding, and the landscape in spring and autumn was dominated by yellow dust, while winter brought nothing but the biting cold and snowy winds from Siberia. During those formative years, I was fortunate enough to catch a glimpse of the pan-Asian Robocon robotics competition on the news. Deeply inspired, I vowed to change this reality—to empower my community to embrace intelligent, technology-driven living, free from the constraints of nature. Fueled by that vision, I worked tirelessly in every exam at the village, county, city, and provincial levels, eventually earning admission to the best high school in Inner Mongolia. The year 2018, my freshman year, became the turning point of my life.

            Armed with the passion and skills nurtured in high school, I went on to university with high hopes. Unfortunately, I soon found myself facing the worst of China’s COVID-19 outbreak, and due to an error choice in my college entrance examination selection system, I ended up at an institution with very limited robotics resources, forcing me to pursue a cybersecurity major—one that did not align with my true interests. So I decided to build my own lab.

            Once my family’s situation stabilized, however slightly, I refused to abandon my passion for robotics. I managed to maintain my cybersecurity major without failing while still clinging to my robotics dreams. During this period, I was fortunate enough to attend a summer camp at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology—a true haven for robotics in China—which further reaffirmed my commitment to the field.

            Aside from competitions, I have developed a strong desire to explore academic research in robotics and other interdisciplinary fields. For instance, in the realm of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), I am interested in developing autonomous planning systems that establish dynamics and energy constraints, generate trajectories using hybrid A* or RRT* algorithms, transform path planning into convex optimization problems with time-constrained polynomials, and ultimately optimize trajectories through numerical methods to output control variables. Similarly, when multiple USVs engage in coordinated formation patrols and encirclement, I envision employing multi-agent reinforcement learning for effective control.

          <p>
            Now I am at the Huzhou Research Institute of Zhejiang University working as a Research Assistant in the FASTLAB. I independently designed a lightweight unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with four fisheye cameras and developed sophisticated algorithms to enable it to fly at high speeds, navigate autonomously, and perform obstacle avoidance in densely mapped environments. I also designed a Lidar-based aerial-ground UAV capable of autonomous navigation in both aerial and ground scenarios, and researched its communication-constrained autonomous exploration algorithm. Moreover, I deployed the exploration algorithm on this versatile UAV in a DARPA-like subterranean environment for detection and mapping (based on improvements to last year's TRO best paper, <em>RACER</em>). In addition, I implemented various localization algorithms (e.g., FASTLIO, ALOAM, LIO-SAM, VINS-Fusion) on UAVs utilizing both visual-inertial odometry (VIO) and LiDAR-inertial odometry (LIO), enabling them to achieve autonomous flight and obstacle avoidance. I further addressed challenges related to relay nodes and ad-hoc network data transmission in UAV swarm exploration. Furthermore, I researched and deployed mapping and navigation algorithms tailored for uneven terrains on both Ackermann and differential-drive vehicles. My goal is to empower off-road robots to execute high-speed autonomous maneuvers on rugged outdoor surfaces, realizing end-to-end high-speed off-road traversal. Currently, I am exploring the integration of conventional optimization methods, SLAM algorithms, and artificial intelligence. I am actively studying stable diffusion and reinforcement learning, with the aim of implementing and deploying these advanced techniques on quadrupedal and humanoid robots in the near future.
          </p>
          <p>
            To conclude, I aim to deepen my studies in cybersecurity, computer science, robotics, and path planning—with a particular focus on fundamental theoretical derivation and hands-on academic practice. My undergraduate projects, while formative, have not yet reached the depth I aspire to, so I am eager to engage in more profound research within a supportive academic environment.
