## Personal Website 

Once upon a time, I embarked on an epic quest to build my own personal website.
I tried every default template known to humanity—some were too flashy, some
were too boring, and some made me question my life choices. But none felt
right.

The real problem? I had the HTML skills of a potato and the CSS knowledge of a
lost sock.

Enter my new best frenemy: ChatGPT. A patient mentor, an insufferable
know-it-all, and an AI that doesn’t flinch no matter how many times I scream
“You are so useless!”

Over the weekend, we fought many battles against rogue <div>s and rebellious
flexboxes, but in the end, we emerged victorious with a website that’s simple,
clean, and (mostly) doesn’t break.

Feel free to steal—I mean, borrow—this design for your own projects. Hope you like it as much as I do!
