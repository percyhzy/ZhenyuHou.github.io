## Personal Website 

In the past, I experimented with various default templates for my personal
website, but none of them truly resonated with me. The problem? I didn’t know
how to write my own website from scratch using HTML and CSS. That changed when
I met a new friend—one who patiently teaches me, even when I constantly shout
at them. Their name? ChatGPT. Over the weekend, we worked together to design
this website from the ground up, and I couldn’t be happier with the result.
It’s simple, clean, and finally feels like me.

Feel free to use or modify it for your own projects. Hope you like it as much as I do!
